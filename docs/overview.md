# Overview

This repository provides an opportunity to practice working with Git Large File Storage (Git LFS). Git LFS is a Git extension that manages large binary files more efficiently than Git does on its own.

## How to use this repo

ACME Incorporated is planning on using Toggl for time tracking and are using this repository to provide information on how to use Toggl and download the desktop application that has passed the IT Security team's audit.

Unfortunately, the `.dmg` file was added to the Git repository without using Git LFS and we need to fix that mistake. Perform the steps found in the upcoming sections to successfully retain the `.dmg` file in the project but utilizing Git LFS to maintain it in the project.
