# Scenario

You work for ACME Incorporated, which is planning on using Toggl for time tracking. They are using this repository to provide information on how to use Toggl, and download the desktop application that has passed the IT Security team's audit.

## Exercise 1

Unfortunately, a `.dmg` file was added to the Git repository without using Git LFS and we need to fix that mistake. In exercise one, you'll perform the steps necessary to successfully retain the `.dmg` file in the project, but migrate it to Git LFS.

## Exercise 2

Now that Git LFS is enabled for the repository, you'll want to tell it to track additional files and file types. In exercise two, you'll add specific files, file types, and file paths.
