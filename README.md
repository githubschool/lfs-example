Hey team! We decided to use [Toggl]() for tracking client work. This repository is going to provide the details on how we want to use Toggl and provide useful links external documentation and installers. 

## Installing Toggl 

To install the Toggl app, make sure to download the desktop application that has gone through our IT Security review found here: [Download Toggl](https://github.com/githubschool/lfs-example/blob/master/TogglDesktop-7_4_373.dmg)

When downloading Toggl, don't forget to use password: `h0wdyP4rtner`

## Time Tracking 101

Individual units of time in Toggl are called Time Entries. Each time entry contains information about the start and stop time, duration and the app used to track the time. Information such as the description, project and tags can also be added to a time entry. 

In the example below...
- **Copywriting** is the time entry description
- **Design** is the project associated with the time entry
- **EastForrest** is the client associated with the "Design" project
- **Antelope** is the tag added to the time entry
- **$** icon signifies that this entry is billable
- **30:03** is the duration of this time entry

### Creating a Time Entry

Time entries can be created in any Toggl app in many different ways. Here are the primary methods of creating a time entry in the Toggl web app. Open the Timer page to get started. 

- **Using the running timer:** Available when the Timer page is set to the Timer mode. Click on the green play button to start the timer or press N on the keyboard. 
- **Using Manual Mode:** Use Manual Mode to enter time entries for activities after they've already happened. Open this article on Manual mode for more information. 
- **Continuing a previous time entry:** Hover over an existing time entry on the Timer page and click on the continue button (the gray play icon) on the right side. Alternatively, press C to continue your last created time entry. Toggl doesn't have a pause feature. Continuing a previous entry is the closest thing in Toggl to pausing. 
- **Inputting a duration:** When in Timer mode, click on the duration field and input a number. Also useful for tracking activities that already happened.
